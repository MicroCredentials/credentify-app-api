Credentify is blockchain-based certificate management for academic institutions and education providers. It is the result of the Euroepan Commission project titled MicroHe, and it functions as a digital credentials clearinghouse.

This is the official private Credentify service repository. Credentify is built on top of a Micro-Credential Meta-data Standard now used by the Europass and elements of open source software.
